# Contributing

1. Clone the repo from [GitHub](https://github.com/tfcp68/yantrix)

This project uses [**pnpm**](https://pnpm.io/), so make sure you have it installed globally. If not, install it using your package manager.

To get started, first clone the repository using:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/tfcp68/yantrix.git
```

Navigate to the project folder:

```shell
cd ./yantrix
```

Install dependencies, which automatically builds and links packages:

```shell
pnpm install
```
