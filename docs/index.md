# Yantrix

Yantrix is a TypeScript framework that provides a set of tools to create robust and self-documented functional applications by code generation.
The business logic is represented by declarative, event-driven [finite state machines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite-state_machine), while the application state is an [Anemic Domain Model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anemic_domain_model), making it great a counterpart to any traditional state manager like [Redux](https://redux.js.org/), while allowing devs to focus on describing contracts and workflows, rather than writing and debugging the
actual code.

Lends itself perfectly to [Architecture-as-Code](https://jondavid-black.github.io/AaC/) paradigm and no-code/less-code tools for developers, like [n8n](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n).
