/**
 * @packageDocumentation
 *
 * The `@yantrix/yantrix-parser` package is a parser for the Yantrix subsyntax found inside of the notes from Mermaid diagrams.
 * Processing done by this package enables most of Yantrix's features, such as event handling, conditional logic, custom functions, etc.
 *
 * It's not encouraged to use this package individually, as it's useful only for processing Yantrix syntax during the creation of automatas
 * together with packages like `automata` and `mermaid-parser` (all of this is included inside of the `core` package).
 *
 * Lexer and parser are created with the help of `@ts/jison` package.
 *
 * See also:
 * - [Yantrix diagram syntax](/syntax)
 * - [Mermaid Parser API](/API/mermaid-parser/)
