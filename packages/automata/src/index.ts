/**
 * @packageDocumentation
 *
 * The `@yantrix/automata` package is a foundational component of the Yantrix framework,
 * designed to create and manage finite state machines (FSMs) with type-safe transitions and event handling in TypeScript.
 *
 * Its core purpose is to:
 * - Provide the core building blocks for Yantrix FSMs
 * - Enable the creation of complex state machines with minimal boilerplate
 * - Ensure that all state transitions and event handling are type-safe
